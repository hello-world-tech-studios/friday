# Artist Website

##### Your going to create a website for you favorite band or artist. Once you've chosen a band and/or artist, make sure to checkout their real website for ideas.

##### Check out some examples here:
* [Taylor Swift](https://taylorswift.com/) <-- lots of hover action
* [Bruno Mars](http://www.brunomars.com/) <-- is that a background video?
* [Sam Hunt](http://www.samhunt.com/) <-- checkout that fadeIn()
* [Leon Bridges](http://leonbridges.com/) <-- parallax image, and cool nav bar

## Set Up Multiple Pages
* Make the following files in your friday folder `home.html`, `tour-dates.html`, `merchandise.html`
* Make a css file called `style.css`
* Link the css file to ALL of your HTML pages by putting `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">` in the `<head>` of ALL of your HTML pages
* Link jQuery using `<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>` in the `<head>` of ALL of your HTML pages
* Make a javascript file called `script.js`
* Link your javascript file using `<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>` in the `<head>` of ALL of your HTML pages


### Home Page
* Create a nav bar and fancy it up!
* Add a background image (you may need to [tint your image](https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/css-background-image-color-overlay/) or a parallax image.
* Add a brief bio for the band and/or artist
* Add the band/artist's most recent music video using the `<iframe>` tag. GOOGLE IT!
* Add links to the band/artist on soundcloud, spotify, youtube, or vimeo

### Tour Dates Page
* Make a table of tour dates with at least 4 tour dates
* Add a 'tickets' button to each tour date here is a good example: 
![tour-dates example](images/example-tour-dates.png)
* Add a form that allows users to sign-up for the mailing list (this will not actually work)
* Add some `hover` effects to your tour dates table


### Merchandise Page
* Include some images of merchandise, along with "Buy now!" buttons.

#### Extensions

* Choose a couple of [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to use on your pages

### Home Page
* Use `fadeIn()` on the nav bar
* Use `show()` to only show the music video once a button is clicked. This will use `click()`! *Note: the button doesn't have to be a button. It could be an image?*
* Add a form that allows users to leave messages for the artist. Once submitted, these messages should be displayed the home page. Review your [message board](https://github.com/hello-world-tech-studios/thursday-PM) for help.

### Tour Dates Page
* Disable the "tickets" button when show is sold out
* Create a secret spot on the page that when the use clicks on it. They will be alerted that they won backstage passes!

### Other ideas
* Add a [slide show](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) of images to one of the pages.
* Try to use spotify or soundcloud to embed a song on one of the pages

### CREATE CREATE CREATE!
* Use your creativity to make your website even more awesome!
