# Artist Website

##### Your going to create a website for you favorite band or artist. Once you've chosen a band and/or artist, make sure to checkout their real website for ideas.

* [Taylor Swift](https://taylorswift.com/) <-- lots of hover action
* [Bruno Mars](http://www.brunomars.com/) <-- is that a background video?
* [Sam Hunt](http://www.samhunt.com/) <-- checkout that fadeIn()
* [Leon Bridges](http://leonbridges.com/) <-- parallax image
